      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone, my name is Derek! I am a junior at Cornell University, majoring in Information Science.</p>
      <p> I have an interest in product and the product lifecycle. Throughout my life, I always found it exciting whenever new products are launched and is what drove me to pursue product management. This past summer, I interned at Mailchimp as a Product Analyst Intern which gave me the opportunity to  analyze large amounts of data, realize how users interact with a product, and solve user pain points.</p>
      <p> In my free time, I love to swim, compose epic orchestral (movie trailer) music, or explore boba shops! </p>
