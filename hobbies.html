      <p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, I was able to travel at least once a year. I took this small opportunity every year to get away from my daily routine and truly get to enjoy the local culture and its cuisine. Some of my favorite places I had visited are Taiwan, Japan, and Germany!</p>

      <p>I would self-diagnose myself as boba addict, I truly love to drink boba and tea in general. Born and raised in Southern California, I was truly priviledged to live in such a vibrant boba scene, with so many boba shops around this area. Growing up, I enjoyed trying different tea shops and their best sellers. Currently, my favorite boba shops are Ten Ren's Tea Time, Wushiland Boba, and Ding Tea.</p>
